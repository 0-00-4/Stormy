###Ghost
* install additional themes?

###Misc/All scripts
* installing unattended-updates for security
* don't forget to disable default/all error pages to avoid easy fingerprinting

###Set up tor:
* done

###Backup Ghost sqlite database
* done

###Create separate script for just installing the Tor Hidden Service (non-ghost)
* (all as above, plus)
* Select directory for hidden service, else `/var/www`
* Select port (or automatically pick one)
* Existing key? [y/N]
  * Key select
* Setup all cron tasks

###Unrelated / Semi-related / Maybe related but only if you're me?
* Shallot-style hsname creation
* Is it possible to save users from themselves?
* Harden their platform for them?

###Other platforms to consider
* APAF is a thing that exists. #peerpressure
* Bloxsom? (I really hate their design though. This would end with me designing a new theme for the platform =/ )
* OONI co-installation to run periodic tests and send the data back to me via hidden service? This would be 10x amaze
