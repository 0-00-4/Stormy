##Ghost
    * init.d script to ensure forever runs on boot
    * script updating procedures for Ghost? Or is this covered by PPA?

##Misc/All scripts
    * installing unattended-updates for security
    * move wat-dection to `domino` function

##Set up tor:
    * Create user `tor`
    * Assign all tasks to user `tor`
    * init.d script to launch HS on boot
    * Output relevant details to file in `/home/tor`
    * Backup keys to `/home/tor`

##Backup Ghost sqlite database
    * cron monthly to `/home/tor/month-year`

##Create separate script for just installing the Tor Hidden Service (non-ghost)
    * (all as above, plus)
    * Select directory for hidden service, else `/var/www`
    * Select port (or automatically pick one)
    * Existing key? [y/N]
          * Key select
    * Setup all cron tasks

###Unrelated / Semi-related / Maybe related but only if you're me?
    * Detect OS and install sudo/su? This would streamline code a bit since I wouldn't need to detect at various intervals, buuut would make it much less portable to BSD and other heretical platforms.
    * At some point, make a BSD vm to get a shallot (maybe future feature for BSD?)
    * Is it possible to save users from themselves?
    * Detect apache/php, and if so, exit script? This would piss a lot of people off, but would reduce the number of (successful) mass attacks against tor hidden services.
    * Harden their platform for them?

###Other platforms to consider
    * APAF is a thing that exists. #peerpressure
    * Bloxsom? (I really hate their design though. This would end with me designing a new theme for the platform =/ )
    * Jekyll -- too advanced for most users of this script, but maybe.
    * moinmoin or other flatfile wiki
    * OONI co-installation to run periodic tests and send the data back to me via hidden service? This would be 10x amaze
